road map
the item after the main url should be the hashtag to look for. 
If the hashtag isn't setup it tell the user and offers an email address to contact asking to set the hashtag up. 

New name of the overall site? ____ Of The Day

Add field to database?

limitations
ties are broken randomly
photo chosen randomly
no pagination
The page can change very abruptly on the user if they are viewing the page when it happens to add stuff. 
I can actually make 'archive' a hashtag because archive by itself goes to views.post,
but then if I wanted to view a post in archive, it would currently go to archive and then try to find the hashtag matching that specific post, but perhaps I could either tighen up the regex that looks for posts ...I can't think of it right now so I'll just roll with it and figure it out later. 

Another thing I need to decide is if the hashtag 'archive' page should be the same as the post archive page.... The structure will be similar? Or maybe don't load images in the hashtag page?
What will be the two keywords? archive/hashtag or hashtags
should I do hashtag/archive? for each hashtag!!!!????? I don't know!!!!!!


Make a function to add all the stuff you add to the post records before sending them client side. 

make clicking on main image open the image in it's own tab, or have it do nothing.
Certainly don't leave it to refresh the page for no reason. 

Start saving the images locally first, than in amazon, then use a postgres database for staging, and then have a live database. 

Maybe have a staging app in heroku? actually make changes with proper workflow etc. 

Even though it looks like I don't have to worry too much about the unicode stuff, I still need to make sure that characters that aren't allowed in URLs get changed to something else. like & and ? and stuff.
