development plan

Use the twitter search to find the most common #useless mutant post.

take everything that appears before the first instance of #uselessmutant to use as the vote. Must include retweets and stuff. 

On days that there is no tweets in the last 7 days with that hashtag, then search google images for "useless mutant" and randomly select an image from the top 100 (or for now just the top 10)

1.) get the google search working. Base function that fetches an image from google, a wrapper that takes a search query and an a number? 
Probably not worth it. 

2.) Play with twitter search 

3.) Get the ranking system working

4.) Decide what happens when the same search is done multiple days in a row. I'm leaning towards having a post per day and just having a counter or something. Like current streak + all time count. On the first day those wouldn't appear, but that's a front end thing. 


The site needs two pages, one showing a single post and one showing all/ paginated history of posts. I currently have the bare bones of both of those things. 

Should I deal with the scenario where the same things wins two days in a row? I could either start taking images that are not the first result OR I could not allow perfect duplicates and then have a tally that shows the current streak and longest streak for that mutant.
