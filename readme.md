This is a django app
Is uses social media to parse through posts with #uselessmutant or #useless_mutant and then finds the most common entry - the non tag part ( I guess I could have a ranking system at some point ).
Once it gets the winning entry for the day it goes to google and gets the first image result associated with that query.
Then it creates a post with that info and that's pretty much it. 

Add this to activate script to get idle to work in virtualenv
set "TCL_LIBRARY=C:\Users\wants\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\tcl\tcl8.6"
then invoke idle with python -m idlelib.idle
